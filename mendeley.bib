abstract = {Frame refreshes, that are used to retain frame images from frame buffers for display subsystems in mobile devices, waste energy and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an intelligent frame refresh mechanism to reduce redundant frame refreshes and useless data accesses to frame buffers, which bridges the semantic gap between frame buffers and frame refreshes, and exploits the knowledge of frame buffers to guide frame refreshes. Based on this mechanism, we introduce two detailed schemes to optimize refreshes by utilizing different information. The flipping-aware frame refresh scheme uses the frame buffer switching operations to detect frame image updates and triggers useful refreshes. The row-level frame refresh scheme supports to refresh only modified rows instead of the whole frame, under the guidance of pixel status information of frame buffers. Our evaluation results show that our proposed mechanism can reduce memory requests by nearly 50% and memory power consumption up to 30%, compared to conventional fixed frame refresh mechanism.},

In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to reduce display energy consumption without compromising user experience. We first define a metric called the content rate from which an appropriate refresh rate is determined for displaying content. The proposed system then sets an optimal refresh rate based on the content rate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system effectively reduces the total power in commercial smartphones, yet the display quality is satisfactorily maintained. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {The energy consumption of mobile apps has become an important consideration for developers as the underlying mobile devices are constrained by battery capacity. Display represents a significant portion of an app's energy consumption—up to 60% of an app's total energy consumption. However, developers lack techniques to identify the user interfaces in their apps for which energy needs to be improved. This paper presents a technique for detecting display energy hotspots—user interfaces of a mobile app whose energy consumption is greater than optimal. The technique leverages display power modeling and automated display transformation techniques to detect these hotspots and prioritize them for developers. The evaluation of the technique shows that it can predict display energy consumption to within 14% of the ground truth and accurately rank display energy hotspots. Furthermore, the approach found 398 display energy hotspots in a set of 962 popular Android apps, showing the pervasiveness of this problem. For these detected hotspots, the average power savings that could be realized through better user interface design was 30%. Taken together, these results indicate that the approach represents a potentially impactful technique for helping developers to detect energy related problems and reduce the energy consumption of their mobile apps.},

For example, we find on average apps spend 61% of their energy in idle states, network is the most energy consuming component, and only a few APIs dominate non-idle energy consumption.

abstract = {Managing the power consumption of display-related components in mobile devices is difficult because of performance degradation. Therefore, eliminating hidden workloads, such as redundant frames, is preferable, as it directly reduces power without affecting the user experience. Our preliminary study shows that the default launcher of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and popular applications, such as Instagram and Pinterest, generate redundant frames. In this paper, we propose a scheme to optimize the power consumption of the smartphone's display-related components by preventing redundant frames generation. By analyzing the frame-generation process, we observe that redundant frame generation is possible in the current Android framework. We then propose a scheme that recognizes and prevents redundant frame generation before actual frame generation (i.e., frame rendering in the GPU). The proposed scheme utilizes a display list, which was introduced in recent Android smartphones for efficient frame generation. We implemented the proposed scheme on Nexus smartphones. On the Nexus 5, the proposed solution reduced the energy of the AOSP default launcher, Instagram, and Pinterest by 40, 35.4, and 39.6 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the experimental results with a general usage scenario showed that our scheme prevented about 35 percent of redundant frame generation with a false-positive rate of 1.8 percent.},

abstract = {App developers publish apps on different platforms, such as Google Play, App Store, and Windows Store, to maximize the user volumes and potential revenues. Due to the different characteristics of the platforms and the different user preference (e.g., Android is more customized than iOS), app testing cases on these three platforms should also be designed differently. Comprehensive app testing can be time-consuming for developers. Therefore, understanding the differences of the app issues on these platforms can facilitate the testing process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named CrossMiner to analyze the essential app issues and explore whether the app issues exhibit differently on the three platforms. Based on five million user reviews, the framework automatically captures the distributions of seven app issues, i.e., 'battery', 'crash', 'memory', 'network', 'privacy', 'spam', and 'UI'. We discover that the apps for different platforms indeed generate different issue distributions, which can be employed by app developers to schedule and design the testing cases. The verification based on the official user forums also demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, we also identify that the issues related to 'crash' and 'network' are more concerned by users than the other issues on these three platforms. To assist developers in gaining a deep insight on the user issues, we also prioritize the user reviews corresponding to the issues. Overall, we aim at understanding the differences of issues on different platforms and facilitating the testing process for app developers.},

Unfortunately, developers lack guidance as to how to improve the energy efficiency of their implementation and which practices are most useful. In this paper we conducted a small-scale empirical evaluation of commonly suggested energy-saving and performance-enhancing coding practices. In the evaluation we evaluated the degree to which these practices were able to save energy as compared to their unoptimized code counterparts. Our results provide useful guidance for mobile app developers. In particular, we found that bundling network packets up to a certain size and using certain coding practices for reading array length information, accessing class fields, and performing invocations all led to reduced energy consumption. However, other practices, such as limiting memory usage had a very minimal impact on energy usage. These results serve to inform the developer community about specific coding practices that can help lower the overall energy consumption and improve the usability of their applications.},

abstract = {Mobile devices have become ubiquitous in the recent years, but the complaints about energy consumption are almost universal. On Android, the developer can choose among several different approaches to develop an app. In this paper, we investigate the impact of some of the most popular development approaches on the energy consumption of Android apps. Our study uses a testbed of 33 different benchmarks and 3 applications on 5 different devices to compare the energy efficiency and performance of the most commonly used approaches to develop apps on Android: Java, JavaScript, and C/C++ (through the NDK tools). In our experiments, Javascript was more energy-efficient in 75% of all benchmarks, while their Java counterparts consume up to 36.27x more energy (median of 1.97x). On the other hand, both Java and C++ outperformed JavaScript in most of the benchmarks. Based on these results, four Java applications were re-engineered to use a combination of Java and either JavaScript or C/C++ functions. For one of the apps, the hybrid solution using Java and C++ spent 10x less time and almost 100x less energy than a pure Java solution. The results were not uniform, however. For another app, when we restructured its implementation so as to minimize cross-language method invocations, the hybrid solution using Java and C++ took 8% longer to execute and consumed 11% more energy than a hybrid solution using Java and JavaScript. Since most Android apps are written solely in Java, the results of this study indicate that leveraging a combination of approaches may lead to non-negligible improvements in energy-efficiency and performance.},

Our primary objective in devising the framework is to enable an engineer to make informed decisions when adapting a system's architecture, such that the energy consumption on hardware devices with a finite battery life is reduced, and the lifetime of the system's key software services increases. Our framework explicitly takes a component-based perspective, which renders it well suited for a large class of today's distributed, embedded, and pervasive applications. The framework allows the engineer to estimate the software system's energy consumption at system construction-time and refine it at runtime. In a large number of distributed application scenarios, the framework showed very good precision on the whole, giving results that were within 5% (and often less) of the actually measured power losses incurred by executing the software. Our work to date has also highlighted a number of possible enhancements. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smartphone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not a-priori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smartphones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Tuysuz2019,
abstract = {Energy efficiency in wireless and cellular networks has become one of the most important concerns for both academia and industry due to battery dependence of mobile devices. In this regard, Wireless Network Interface Cards (WNICs) of mobile devices have to be taken into account carefully as they consume an important chunk of the system's total energy. In this paper, we propose a real-time network power consumption profiler and an energy-aware network/interface selection tool for Android-based smartphones. The tool has been freely released on the Android Play Store. The proposed solution reports the power consumption levels of different network interfaces (Wi-Fi and Cellular) by making use of actual packet measurements and precise computations, and enables the devices to handover horizontally/vertically in order to improve the energy efficiency. In this context, widespread analyses have been executed to show the accuracy of the proposed tool. The results demonstrate that the proposed tool is very accurate for any type of IEEE 802.11 wireless or cellular stations, regardless of having different amount of channel utilization, transmission rates, signal strengths or traffic types.},

@article{Linares-Vasquez2018,
abstract = {The number of mobile devices sold worldwide has exponentially increased in recent years, surpassing that of personal computers in 2011. Such devices daily download and run millions of apps that take advantage of modern hardware features (e.g., multi-core processors, large Organic Light-Emitting Diode—OLED—screens, etc.) to offer exciting user experiences. Clearly, there is a cost to pay in terms of energy consumption and, in particular, of reduced battery life. This has pushed researchers to investigate how to reduce the energy consumption of apps, for example, by optimizing the color palette used in the app's GUI. Whilst past research in this area aimed at optimizing energy while keeping an acceptable level of contrast, this article proposes an approach, named Gui Energy Multi-objective optiMization for Android apps (GEMMA), for generating color palettes using a multi-objective optimization technique, which produces color solutions optimizing energy consumption and contrast while using consistent colors with respect to the original color palette. The empirical evaluation demonstrates (i) substantial improvements in terms of the three different objectives, (ii) a concrete reduction of the energy consumption as assessed by a hardware power monitor, (iii) the attractiveness of the generated color compositions for apps' users, and (iv) the suitability of GEMMA to be adopted in industrial contexts.},
